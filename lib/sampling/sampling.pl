/** <module> Random sampling from lists and goal results.

Two types of Sampling
=====================

Predicates in this list perform two kinds of sampling:
a) Simple random sampling, with or without replacement, or
b) Bernoulli sampling.

Conceptually, the difference between the two types of sampling is that
simple random sampling returns a result of predictable size, whereas
Bernoulli sampling may return a result with a different size each time,
even given the same parameters.

Operationally, this is because Bernoulli sampling performs a Bernoulli
trial for each element of its sampling frame, and only selects for the
end result those elements for which a trial succeeds. Since this
selection is random, its results, and therefore their number, cannot be
predicted.

The tradeoff is one between efficiency and precision. Simple random
sampling is precise in the number of elements selected, but this
precision comes at a cost of complexity. Bernoulli sampling is dead
simple, but this simplicity comes at the cost of precision.

In general, both kinds of sampling produce either a list representing a
random _sample_, or two or more lists, representing _partitions_, of the
given sampling frame. The sampling frame can be either a list, or the
set of results of a Prolog goal.

Predicates performing simple random sampling invariably sample from the
elements of a list. Bernoulli sampling predicates may sample from the
elements of a list, or from the results of a goal.

The interface of simple random sampling predicates
==================================================

The different purpose of predicates performing simple random sampling
can be gleaned from their names. The following naming conventions are
observed:

a) n_X_Ys*: Perform N times the purpose Y on an instance of X. N must be
an integer, X is in [list,goal] and Y is in [partition/s, sample/s].

Example: n_list_partitions/3, partitions a list into n partitions.

b) p_X_Ys*: Select a proportion of P elements or results of X for a set
of Ys. P must be either a percentage in [0,100] or a probability in
[0.0,1.0]. X is in [list,goal], and Y is in [partition/s,sample/s].

Example: p_list_partitions/4 partitions the elements of a list Ls so
that the first partition has P elements for some proportion P of |Ls|
and the second partition has the remaining elements of Ls.

c) k_X_Ys*: Select exactly K elements of results of X for a set of Ys. K
must be an integer between 0 and the maximum number of elements or
results of X. X is in [list,goal] and Y is in [partition/s, sample/s].

Example: k_list_partitions/4 partitions the elements of a list Ls so
that the first partition has exactly K elements of Ls and the second
partition has all the remaining elements of Ls.

The interface of Bernoulli sampling predicates
==============================================

Bernoulli sampling predicates always take a probability as the parameter
that determines the size of the sample, or first partition. They observe
the following naming convention:

a) X_Ys*: Perform Bernoulli sampling with some probability of success P,
on all elements, or results of X, producing a set of Ys. X is in
[list,goal] and Ys is one of [partition/s,sample/s].

Example: goal_samples/4 performs a Bernoulli trial on all results of
a goal G and produces the list of all results of G for which a trial
succeeded.

Bernoulli sampling predicates are based on the predicate
bernoulli_trial/2. This performs a bernoulli trial with a given
probability and returns an atom A in [true,false], depending on whether
the trial succceeded (where A = true) or failed (A = false).

Representation of probabilities
===============================

In both types of sampling predicates, where a probability is required,
it can be represented in one of two ways:
a) As a float, in the closed interval [0.0,1.0], or,
b) As a percentage, an integer in the closed interval [0,100]

%!	n_list_partitions(+Size,+List,-Partitions) is det.
%
%	Partition a List to random Partitions of equal Size.
%
%	Size may be an integer or a float. If it is an integer,
%	Partitions is a list of sublists of List of the given Size. If
%	it is a float, the length of sublists is Size * |List|. In both
%	cases, the elements of each sublist are selected at random and
%	without replacement and the union of Partitions is List.
%
%	Example:
%	==
%	?- interval(1,10,1,_Is), n_list_partitions(0.5,_Is,Ps).
%	Ps = [[1, 4, 7, 8, 9], [2, 3, 5, 6, 10]].
%
%	?- interval(1,10,1,_Is), n_list_partitions(5,_Is,Ps).
%	Ps = [[1, 2, 3, 6, 8], [4, 5, 7, 9, 10]].
%	==
%
%	Raises an error if the length of List cannot be divided exactly
%	by Size.
%
%	Note that when Size is a float, because of floating point
%	arithmetic it may be necessary to give multiple decimal digits
%	to avoid errors. For instance:
%	==
%	?- interval(1,9,1,_Is), sampling:n_list_partitions(0.3,_Is,Ps).
%	ERROR: Unhandled exception: 'Partition size must be exact divisor of list size!'
%
%	?- interval(1,9,1,_Is), sampling:n_list_partitions(0.3333333333333333,_Is,Ps).
%	Ps = [[2, 6, 8], [3, 4, 5], [1, 7, 9]].
%	==
%
%	Er. I think the exact size of decimal digits depends on the
%	words size of your computer's processor architecture. That's as
%	far as I'm prepared to think about this.

%!	p_list_partitions(+Ratio,+List,-Keeps,-Skips) is det.
%
%	Partition a list into two disjoint partitions.
%
%	Keeps and Skips are two subsets of the elements of List such
%	that:
%	a) List is the union of Keeps and Skips, and,
%	b) The intersection of Keeps and Skips is empty.
%
%	Ratio is the ratio of elements of List in Keeps. It may be given
%	as either an integer or a floating-point. The number of elements
%	in Skips is the complement of Ratio out of 100 (if Ratio is an
%	integer) or out of 1.0 (if a float).
%
%	If Ratio is an integer, it must be between 1 and 100; if it is a
%	floating point number, it must be between 0.1 and 1.0.
%	Otherwise, a type error is raised.
%
%	Example:
%	==
%	?- interval(1,10,1,_Is), p_list_partitions(0.2,_Is,Ks,Ss).
%	Ks = [5, 3],
%	Ss = [4, 2, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

%	Ks = [8, 7],
%	Ss = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 10].
%	==
%
%	Use this to create two list partitions when a) you know the size
%	of the original List, b) you need partitions of a specific size
%	or ratio and c) you don't mind storing three, possibly large,
%	lists in memory.
%
%	@tbd The "three, possibly large, lists" that must be kept in
%	memory, mentioned above are List, Keeps and Skips, although note
%	that List gets smaller as the other two grow, so the amount of
%	memory taken up by this should not be much larger than twice the
%	size of List. I think.

%
%	Keep, or skip, Elements of a List according to a Probability.
%
%	Performs a Bernoulli trial for each element of a List that
%	unifies with Element with the given Probability of success.
%
%	Probability can be given as either a real number, in [0,1],
%	or a percentage, in [0,100].
%
%	Element may be a nonground compound term, for instance
%	p(X,Y). If List is of a non-uniform type, this will act as a
%	filter of sorts, only binding terms that conform to the pattern
%	in Element.
%
%	Keep is one of [true,false]. Keep is true for each Element of
%	List for which a trial succeeded and false for every other
%	Element of List.
%
%	Example:
%	==
%	?- interval(1,5,1,_Is)
%	,findall(n(I,K),(member(I,_Is),nextto(I,K,_Is)),_Ns)
%	,list_partition(10,n(X,Y),_Ns,K).

%	X = 2,
%	Y = 3 ;

%	Y = 4 ;

%!	bernoulli_trial(+Probability,-Result) is det.
%
%	Perform a Bernoulli Trial.
%
%	Probability is the probability of success of the trial. Result
%	is one of [true,false]. Result is true with the given
%	Probability and false with probability 1 - Probability.
%
%	Probability can be a float or an integer. If it is a float it
%	must be a number in the closed interval [0.0,1.0]. If it is an
%	integer, it must be in the closed interval [0,100]. Otherwise,
%	a type error is raised.
