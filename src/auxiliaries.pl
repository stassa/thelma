%!	order_constraints(+Target,-Predicates,-Constants,+Default) is
%!	det.
%
%	Assign an automatic ordering to the Herbrand base.
%
%	Description
%	-----------
%
%	Target can be one of two things:
%	a) A compound, Q/N, the symbol and arity of a target predicate.
%	b) A list of predicates' symbols and arities.
%
%	If Target is a compound, Q/N, it's used to access the
%	definitions of the predicates declared as background knowledge
%	for the target predicate Q/N in the currently configured
%	experiment file.
%
%	If Target is a list of symbols and arities, it is used to
%	accesss the definitions of the predicates with those symbols and
%	arities in the currently configured experiment file.
%
%	The first option allows quick experimentation with the settings
%	in an experiment file. The second option allows for finer
%	control, e.g. to check the ordering of arbitrary combinations of
%	background predicates.
%
%	Note however that if you pass in a list of predicates' symbols
%	and arities as Target, their definitions must be in the current
%	experiment file module, or a module imported by the experiment
%	file module, otherwise an existence error will be raised.
%
%	Motivation
%	----------
%
%	The purpose of this predicate is to allow a user to define the
%	lexicographic and interval ordering of background predicates
%	declared in an experiment file and their constants, without any
%	additional work, besides the declaration of those predicates.
%	Specifically, it is meant to obviate the need for a special
%	predicate storing a hand-crafted list of each kind of term
%	in the required order.
%
%	The relevant ordering is instead automatically determined a) by
%	the order in which predicates are declared as background
%	knowledge (by including their symbols and aritities in the list
%	given as the second argument of the background_knowledge/2
%	predicate), b) in the order in which atoms of background
%	predicates are generated, or appear in the source file
%	(depending on whether a predicate is intentionally or
%	extensionally defined) and, c) the order in which constants
%	appear in predicates' atoms.
%
%	Although this ordering may still require some consideration on
%	the part of the user, it can be managed as part of the normal
%	process of declaring background knowledge which the user will
%	probably have to perform anyway.
%
%	Explanation
%	-----------
%
%	Predicates is a list representing an ordered sequence of unique
%	predicate symbols {P1, P2,... Pn} where each Pi is the symbol of
%	a predicate in the background knowledge and Pj is above Pk in
%	the lexicographic ordering of predicates iff {Pj,Pk} is a
%	subsequence of the sequence represented by Predicates.
%
%	Similarly, Constants is a list [C1, C2, ... Cn] where each
%	Ci is a constant in an atom of a background predicate and Cj
%	is above Ck in the interval ordering of constants iff [Cj,Ck]
%	are in Constants.
%
%	The two orderings are assigned according to the appearance of
%	(Prolog) terms in an experiment file, provided by the user.
%	Specifically:
%
%	a) Each predicate is assigned a rank equal to its position in
%	the list in the second argument of background_knowledge/2,
%	defined in the experiment file.
%
%	b) Each constant C is assigned one or more indexing terms I/J/K,
%	where: I is the rank of a predicate P such that one or more
%	atoms of P include C as a term; J is 1 if C is the first term or
%	2 if it's the second term of that predicate; and K is the index
%	of the atom of P in which C appears as a term (K coincides with
%	the index, in the dynamic database, of the clause of P
%	representing that atom, if P is defined extensionally; a clause
%	index can be obtained in Swi Prolog with the built-in
%	nth_clause/3).
%
%	The relative order of constants then depends on the I/J/K
%	indexing terms assigned to them. Given a pair of constants, C1,
%	C2, C1 is above C2 in the total interval ordering iff I1/J1/K1 >
%	I2/J2/K2 (where the indexing subscripts match the contstant
%	subscripts).
%
%	When a constant appears multiple times in different atoms of
%	possibly different predicates, it is assigned multiple
%	indexings. This is resolved by taking into account the
%	value of the configuration option default_ordering/1. If that is
%	set to "lower", the indexing resulting in the lowest possible
%	ordering is used to determine the order of the constant in
%	Constants. If it is set to "higher", the highest ordering is
%	used instead.
%
%	@tbd This could be refactored to allow passing an arbitrary list
%	of predicate indicators defined in any module (not just the
%	current experiment file), or, even better, an arbitrary list of
%	predicate definitions.

%
%	The purpose of this predicate is, very specifically, to allow a

%	during disprove/2, to be removed from the dynamic database
%	without stumbling over module scoping that can be complicated
%	when a predicate is declared in one module and then clauses of
%	it are added in another module.
%
%	For example, the following is what you should expect to see in
%	the dynamic database after a theory of father/2 is learned and
%	asserted in the dynamic database, while there is also background
%	knowledge of father/2:
%
%	==
%	[debug] [1]  ?- listing(thelma:father/2).

%	true.
%	==
%
%	This happens because we allow the same experiment modules to
%	export background predicates that have the same symbol and
%	arities with target predicates declared in the same module. It
%	means that it's very fiddly to remove the clauses of the learned
%	theory, especially while leaving the background predicate
